Overview
Online Notepad is a free browser-based text editor that allows you to create and edit multiple plain-text files in your browser. No registration or login required. It is great for writing quick notes and printing simple pages. What makes it special is the autosave functionality, which saves your draft every second. This prevents data loss in case you accidentally close the tab or the browser window suddenly crashes. The document you're working on will be automatically restored when you visit again, even when you close and reopen your browser. There's also support for saving documents directly to your computer. Online Notepad is packed with core features that your common text editor provides, including undo, redo, copy, cut, paste, find and replace, font formatting, character map, insert date and time, emoji list, spell checker, word counter, open and save files, and print page.

How does it work?
Changes are saved automatically as you work thanks to HTML5 localStorage API. It grabs a copy of the content from the text editor and saves it to your computer. With this method, your data never leaves your device. The default time interval at which drafts are saved is 1000ms or 1 second. Your notes will stay in the web browser until you clear the cookies and other site data. You can try it out by typing anything in the editor and refreshing the page.

Browser Compatibility
Online Notepad supports modern web browsers including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge, Internet Explorer and Steam browser. You need to enable JavaScript in order to use the app.
